## Data Science Capstone
In the Data Science Capstone Project, I developed an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict whether a Space X Falcon 9 First stage would land based on historical data. 
 * Data was collected through webscraping Wikipedia and the SpaceX
 * Wrangled Data by cleaning, filtering, and creating a binary landing outcome class
 * Performed EDA using Visualization, pandas, and SQL
 * Created interactive map-based visuals using Folium
 * Created a Plotly Dash dashboard 
 * Further cleaned and split data into training and testing sets
 * Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models 
 * Assessed model performance with scikit-learn scoring metrics and Confusion Matrix
## Python for Data Science
 * Data Types and Programming Fundamentals
 * Exception Handling
 * Objects and Classes
 * Working with Data: Reading and Writing Files
 * Pandas, Numpy
 * APIs: Simple, REST, HTTP Requests
 * Working with files: csv, xml, json, xlsx

## Analyzing Data with Python
 * Importing data
 * Analyzing data with pandas
 * Cleaning/Wrangling data: missing values, formatting, normalization, binning, one-hot encoding
 * EDA: Descriptive/Summary Statistics, Scatter plots, heat maps, correlation statistics (pearson, chi-square, ANOVA)
 * Model Development: Simple and Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Pipelines, Measures (MSE, R-Squared)
 * Model Refinement: Test/Train Split, Generalization Performance, Cross Validation, Ridge Regression, Grid Search, 

## Visualization with Python
 * Visualization for EDA, Communication
 * Matplotlib - Scatter, Area, Histogram, Bar, Pie, Box plots
 * Seaborn - lineplot, scatterplot, regplot, displot, boxplot
 * Folium - maps, markers, terrain, toner, cloropleth
 * Dashboards - Plotly, Dash

## Python Project for Data Science
 * Performed webscraping using html requests and beautiful soup to obtain stock data 
 * Obtained stock data using yFinance
 * Created a dashboard using plotly

## Databases and SQL
 * Basic SQL statements
 * Create and modify live databases
 * DDL vs. DML
 * String patterns, ranges, sorting, ordering, sub- and nested queries
 * Access, manipulate, and query databases from Python

## Machine Learning with Python
 * Linear, Multiple Linear, Non-Linear, Polynomial Regression
 * Metrics for Regression models
 * Classification models: KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVMs
 * Evaluation of Classification models
 * Clustring: k-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN
 * Recommender Systems: Content Based, Collaborative Filtering
 * Final project evaluating the best classifier between KNN, Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression
