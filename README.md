## Data Science Capstone
In the Data Science Capstone Project, I developed an end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict whether a Space X Falcon 9 First stage would land based on historical data. 
 * Data was collected through webscraping Wikipedia and the SpaceX
 * Wrangled Data by cleaning, filtering, and creating a binary landing outcome class
 * Performed EDA using Visualization, pandas, and SQL
 * Created interactive map-based visuals using Folium
 * Created a Plotly Dash dashboard 
 * Further cleaned and split data into training and testing sets
 * Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN models 
 * Assessed model performance with scikit-learn scoring metrics and Confusion Matrix
